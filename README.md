# World-Development-Indicators-in-Madagascar


<h2>Do the rise of Mobile subscriptions tend to impact the GDP in emerging

dataset obtained from the World Bank containing over a thousand annual indicators of economic
development from hundreds of countries around the world.
This is a slightly modified version of the original dataset from The World Bank.
